        <p class="text-justify">
            CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was born out of the educational vision
            of St Kuriakose Elias Chavara, an educationalist and social reformer of
            the nineteenth century in South India. He founded the first Catholic
            indigenous congregation, Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI), in 1831,
            which administers CHRIST (Deemed to be University). Established in 1969
            as Christ College, it undertook path-breaking initiatives in Indian

            and identified it as an Institution with Potential for Excellence in
