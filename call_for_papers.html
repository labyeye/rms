            IEEE Computer Society Bangalore Chapter and IEEE Computer Society
            Student Branch Chapter CHRIST University Bangalore are organizing the
            second edition of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Contemporary
            Computing and Communications (InC4) on March 15-16, 2024, in association
            with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, School of
            Engineering and Technology, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Kengeri
            Campus, Bengaluru, India. The IEEE InC4-2024 aims to bring researchers,
            academicians, industry, and government personnel together to share and
            discuss the various aspects of Computing and Communications. The
            conference will witness multiple eminent keynote speakers from academia
            and industry worldwide and the presentation of accepted peer-reviewed
            articles. The IEEE InC4 2024 conference proceeding will be submitted for
            inclusion in IEEE XPLORE digital library.
